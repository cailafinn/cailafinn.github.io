A software engineer and motorbike fanatic. Sometimes she writes about bikes she's ridden and stuff she's working on, because yelling into the void is how you find out what's out there. 

She's also a professional photographer, currently contracting for BikerPics, a Roadside Photography company with photographers across the UK.
