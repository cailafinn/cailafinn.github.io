*Honda have made the authentic cruiser experience accessible to everyone holding an A2 licence... it's just a shame that the experience sucks.*

There's a lot to like about the Rebel when you see it sat in the garage. The low seat hight is reassuring, allowing even the shortest riders to have their feet flat when sat on it. Its small size, low mass, and wide bars give plenty of leverage to bring the bike upright. The mid-board footpegs are perfectly placed above your feet and just where you would expect them to be as you pull away. Even the styling looks right. The round mirrors and big headlight look friendly. The high teardrop tank, low seat, fat tyres, and dual shocks put in a lot of work to make this very small bike look bigger than it is. Full-size, but without being intimidating. 

The positive feelings continue when you get the engine going, as long as you've managed to work out that the steering lock and ignition switches are on opposite sides of the bike (c'mon Honda, was this to make the bike feel "authentic" or were you just being cheap?). Despite using the same 471cc, 47hp 180ยบ p-twin from the rest of the CB500 range, Honda retuned the engine to provide more low-end torque. 43.2Nm at 6000RPM. They also redesigned the muffler while transposing the engine from the Rebel's sportier sisters. This provides a bit more of that cruiser growl off-idle... something the most boring engine configuration in modern motorcycling desperately needs to stand out, which it does succeed at. 

Chugging around town, the Rebel feels great. The increased low-end torque, the arms-out riding position, and the Rebel's new voice provide a satisfying heave as you pull out of the garage or away from a set of lights, making the bike's engine feel much stronger than it is. The wide handlebars make it effortless to flick around junctions, potholes, and traffic. The fat rear tyre, long rake, and cupped rear seat allow both bike and rider to feel supported and stable, so it never feels out of control either.

The Rebel's strong start begins to falter on the open road, however. Probably thanks to their positioning, when cornering the pegs feel like they're as wide as the handlebars. I'm no stranger to touching a peg to the ground when cornering quickly, but almost every single roundabout causes the right-hand peg to scrape along the tarmac. For sure, it's fun the first few times when you're out for fun, but quickly gets tiresome when it unsettled the rear four times during your commute to work. The brakes are surprisingly awful. The rear pedal feels like pressing down on a treacle-filled sponge and the front lever only vaguely feels like it's connected to that single front disc brake. This is doubly confusing when compared with the brakes on the other Honda 500 models. Despite being nothing to write home about, they are leagues better than this. 

 I'll be the first to admit that I'm the wrong shape for the Rebel. At 182cm the footpegs are too high and the rubber grips on the frame too low for my knees to press against. This leaves only the teardrop tank, which is inset *just* enough so that the clutch cover bullies my shins for space. But Honda *knew* this would be a problem! A thick, black, plastic protector has been added over the clutch cover, which, yes, does stop the engine from burning my legs, but also takes up even more of the limited real estate caused by those mid-board footpegs being perfectly in-line with the motor. On the long ride home from Wales it quickly aggravated my back. The riding position then makes it almost impossible to stand and stretch without pulling yourself up via the bars, which can cause the occasional wobble. Fortunately, you don't have to stay sat on it for very long. The tank barely holds enough fuel for 90 miles before the 4-bar gauge starts whining, begging for more. 

To sum up, the Rebel has it's place in Honda's line-up as a introductory style symbol. They need something to bring in the newer, shorter, or less-confident rider so they can feel their way into the full-sized Rebel 1100. But unless you're one of the very newest or shortest riders, who need the confidence inspired by being able to flat foot your new machine, just buy any of the other Honda 500s and experience a much more comfortable, versatile, and enjoyable ride.
