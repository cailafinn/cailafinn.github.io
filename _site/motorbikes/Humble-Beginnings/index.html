      <p>My first step to motorbike ownership… I have a CBT certificate! This tells my insurance company or a nosy police officer that I have completed the UK’s Compulsory Basic Training for motorcycle competence. This basically means that I’m slightly less likely to kill myself or others if I’m out on the road.</p>

<p>The day began with meeting my instructor and the other person I’d be spending the day with, James. I was going to be riding a geared, 125cc Lexmoto ZSB motorbike, and he’d be on a 125cc scooter. We were then taken to the bikes and given some information on proper care and maintenance. This included two acronyms:</p>

<p>BEST COPS (done every week or so):</p>

<p>B: Brakes<br />
E: Electrics<br />
S: Suspension<br />
T: Tyres<br />
C: Chain<br />
O: Oil<br />
P: Petrol<br />
S: Steering</p>

<p>and BOLTS (done before each ride):</p>

<p>B: Brakes<br />
O: Oil<br />
L: Lights<br />
T: Tyres<br />
S: Steering</p>

<p>Given that James, the other student, had already done the CBT and knew how to ride, I was then shown how to take the bike off its centre stand: Lean it back and push it forwards. Then I had to get it back on… It is at this moment I reach to grab the front brake, lean <em>slightly</em> too far, and 125kg of motorbike overpowers 60kg of me and we both fall to the floor in a heap.</p>

<p>Welp… better my first drop happens to someone elses bike.</p>

<p>With the only damage being to my shins and my pride; we continue with some low speed manuevers, learning how to approach junctions, and how to use both the clutch and rear brake to control my speed (rather than the throttle).</p>

<p>After that, we go to lunch, do a bit of highway code study, and then it’s time to gear up for the road practice. We’re both on the receiving end of a one way radio from our instructor, who talks us through each manoeuver. We pulled over a few times to practice U-turns and emergency stops, and then headed out onto the more open roads. This is where I really wish James wasn’t on a scooter. I was desperate to open the taps and go for some corners. But when forced to follow a scooter that taps out at 33mph, it’s just not possible.</p>

<p>It was on the country lanes that I fell in love. Even on the most uncomfortable seat in the world, I never wanted to stop. Opening the taps and hearing that exhaust note right behind you is such a rush.</p>

<p>I would tell anyone who is confused by people who ride motorbikes to just book a CBT and give it a go. The instructors are usually delightful and really passionate. They’ll talk you through everything and make sure whatever you’re doing is safe and secure.</p>

<p>You might just discover it’s the hobby you’ve always been waiting for.</p>
